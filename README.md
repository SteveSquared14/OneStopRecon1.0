## Project Description

This project has been developed so that passive reconnaissance can be conducted more efficiently - through a mixture of industry standard command, and bespoke, custom-developed tools. The tool can perform the following passive reconnaissance techniques: Dorking, banner grabbing, metadata extraction, google maps requester, name server enumeration, Shodan query, extraction of txt files (Robot.txt and Security.txt) from sites and whoIS. The whole purpose of this tool is to have a more centralised system to conduct the passive reconnaissance more effectively to optimise results in the fast time available.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SteveSquared14/OneStopRecon.git
cd OneStopRecon 
bash install.sh
./OneStopRecon.sh
```
## Usages

Within this tool there are multiple passive reconnaissance techniques implemented into one tool. The techniques that are implemented are mentioned in the “project descriptions”. Usages of each tool are shown down below. 

```bash
Dorking: “-dB” (Bing), “-dD” (Duck Duck Go) & “-dG” (Google), Syntax = ./OneStopRecon.sh -dG yourTerm (Advisory: On the google search engine you could potentiality encounter captcha issue.To fix this issue you will need clear the cache within the browser.)
Banner Grabbing: “-g”, Syntax = ./OneStopRecon.sh -g URL (e.g., mchoglay.com) 
Metadata Extraction: “-M”, Syntax = ./OneStopRecon.sh -M FileName (Note: you can pass more than 1 file) 
Google Maps Requester: “-m”, Syntax = ./OneStopRecon.sh -m full address or location (e.g., 43 crescent, Salford M5 4WT) 
Name Sever Enumeration: “-n”, Syntax = ./OneStopRecon.sh -n URL (e.g., mchoglay.com) 
Shodan: “-s”, Syntax = ./OneStopRecon.sh -s IP address or a term (e.g., 8.8.8.8 or Hikvision) 
Text file recon: “-t”, Syntax = ./OneStopRecon.sh -t URL (e.g., mchoglay.com) 
Whois: “-w”, Syntax = ./OneStopRecon.sh -w URL (e.g., mchoglay.com) 
```
